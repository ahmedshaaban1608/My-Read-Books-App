## Project Description

In the MyReads project, I created a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. You can also search and add more books in the /search page. The three shelves are:
.Currently Reading
.Want to Read
.Read
